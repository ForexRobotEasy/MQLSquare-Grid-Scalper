## Product Description

MQLSquare Grid Scalper is a Forex trading robot that utilizes a grid trading strategy with a multiplier effect. The robot is designed to place buy and sell orders based on market trends, with the aim of generating profits from price fluctuations.

The strategy used by MQLSquare Grid Scalper involves opening multiple trades at specific price levels, with each trade having an increased lot size compared to the previous one. This allows the robot to take advantage of market volatility and potentially maximize profits.

- **Lot Size**: The initial lot size for each trade.
- **Multiplier**: The factor by which the lot size is increased for each subsequent trade.
- **MaxTrades**: The maximum number of trades that can be opened.
- **Slippage**: The allowed slippage value in pips.
